Modulo in assembly is another interesting concept!

        x86 allows you to get the remainder after a div operation.

        For instance: 10 / 3 -> remainder = 1

        The remainder is the same as modulo, which is also called the "mod" operator.

        In most programming languages we refer to mod with the symbol '%'.

        Please compute the following:
          rdi % rsi

        Place the value in rax.
