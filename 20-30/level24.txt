Now, we will combine the two prior levels and perform the following:
  Create a two jump trampoline:
    Make the first instruction in your code a jmp
    Make that jmp a relative jump to 0x51 bytes from its current position
    At 0x51 write the following code:
      Place the top value on the stack into register rdi
      jmp to the absolute address 0x403000
