Another cool concept in x86 is the ability to independently access to lower register bytes.

        Each register in x86_64 is 64 bits in size, and in the previous levels we have accessed
        the full register using rax, rdi or rsi.

        We can also access the lower bytes of each register using different register names.

        For example the lower 32 bits of rax can be accessed using eax, the lower 16 bits using ax,
        the lower 8 bits using al.

        MSB                                    LSB
        +----------------------------------------+
        |                   rax                  |
        +--------------------+-------------------+
                             |        eax        |
                             +---------+---------+
                                       |   ax    |
                                       +----+----+
                                       | ah | al |
                                       +----+----+

        Lower register bytes access is applicable to almost all registers.

        Using only one move instruction, please set the upper 8 bits of the ax register to 0x42.
