Recall the following:
          The breakdown of the names of memory sizes:
            Quad Word   = 8 Bytes = 64 bits
            Double Word = 4 bytes = 32 bits
            Word        = 2 bytes = 16 bits
            Byte        = 1 byte  = 8 bits

        In x86_64, you can access each of these sizes when dereferencing an address, just like using
        bigger or smaller register accesses:
          mov al, [address]        <=>        moves the least significant byte from address to rax
          mov ax, [address]        <=>        moves the least significant word from address to rax
          mov eax, [address]       <=>        moves the least significant double word from address to rax
          mov rax, [address]       <=>        moves the full quad word from address to rax

        Please perform the following:
          Set rax to the byte at 0x404000
          Set rbx to the word at 0x404000
          Set rcx to the double word at 0x404000
          Set rdx to the quad word at 0x404000
