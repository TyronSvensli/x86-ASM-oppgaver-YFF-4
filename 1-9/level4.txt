Using your new knowledge, please compute the following:
          f(x) = mx + b, where:
            m = rdi
            x = rsi
            b = rdx

        Place the result into rax.

        Note: there is an important difference between mul (unsigned
        multiply) and imul (signed multiply) in terms of which
        registers are used. Look at the documentation on these
        instructions to see the difference.

        In this case, you will want to use imul.
